I am a double major studying mathematics and computer science. The computer science is a new addition for me. I hope to enforce the programming I do know and get a good foundation for the classes I have ahead of me. 
I moved here from Denver, Colorado in order to come back to school to finish my degree in mathematics and now live with my parents in order to concentrate on school. Currently, my day job is in an investigative office working for a couple of PI's. This sounds far more glamorous in my mind than it is in real life. Really I spend most of my time on the phone tracking down information from various companies. I handle medical investigations, so these companies are usually doctors or hospitals. When not doing that I'm the lab assistant for CSC 125 or I can be found tutoring math or doing my own math homework.
