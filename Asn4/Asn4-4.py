"""
4.	Complete Asn4-4.py to calculate the shooting percentages of all the NBA
teams in the 2009 season (use the file 2009_shots.csv). Use the shots programs
written in class that use a dictionary as a model. For full credit, use a dictionary
in which the keys are the NBA teams (from the first column) and the values are lists
([shots_made, shots_attempted]). Print the teams and their shooting percentages in
alphabetical order (the team names are the ones in column 1 of the spreadsheet).
The structure of the program is provided in the given Asn4-4.py.

5.	Modify Asn4-4.py to print the teams in order of shooting percentage, from
highest to lowest.
6.	Extend Asn4-4.py to print the teamsâ€™ overall shooting percentages and
also their 3 point shooting percentages
(three_point_shots_made/three_point_shots_attempted)
